    "## Multithreading\n",
    "* As we know, when multiple tasks are executed at the same time, we call it multitasking.\n",

    "* So, what is multithreading?\n",
    "* Multithreading is defined as the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently.\n",
    "* The central processing unit (CPU) or a single core in a multi-core processor executes multiple processes or threads concurrently, appropriately supported by the operating system.\n",
    "* Multiple threads may execute individually while sharing their process resources. The purpose of multithreading is to run multiple tasks and function calls at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**#Example**\n",
    "* Let's take a simple example to understand what we discussed on the previous screen.\n",
    "* Assume that you are using Amazon. While using you might search for the items you wish to buy. So you would click on the search button, for example, you might search for, 'earphones'.\n",
    "* When you click on the search button, one thread will fetch the data from the database related to earphones.\n",
    "* Another thread (which is the main thread), will maintain the current screen until the search thread fetches the data.\n",
    "* Therefore, at the same time two tasks are running, one in the background (which is the search thread) and the second is the main thread (which maintains the current screen on the app until the search thread completes fetching of the data).\n",
    "* This is multi-threading in simple words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**#Multithreading Vs Multiprocessing**\n",
    "* Are multithreading and multiprocessing the same?\n",
    "* No! Multithreading differs from multiprocessing, as with multithreading the processes and threads have to share the resources of a single or multiple cores..\n",
    "* While multiprocessing systems include multiple processing units.\n",
    "* Multithreading aims to increase the utilization of a single core by using thread-level as well as instruction-level parallelism.\n",
    "* As the two techniques are complementary, they are sometimes combined in systems with multiple multithreading CPUs and in CPUs with multiple multithreading cores.\n",
    "#As we have seen, multithreading is the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently.Therefore, when we talk about the large scale applications that need to handle multiple tasks concurrently, then multithreading becomes an important feature."

    "* At any given time, a philosopher must either eat or think.\n",
