    "* When we read data from the database using Python, it provides various methods to do that.\n",
    "* When we fetch the whole table using the SELECT command, we can use the fetchall() method over the cursor object which will fetch all the rows from the table and store them in a tuple.\n",
    "* Now if you go to your MySQL command line and fetch the data, you will see nothing! Boom!\n",
    "* Where did the data disappear that we just inserted?\n",
    "* Whenever we make changes in our database or perform any operation that would manipulate the database, we will need to tell MySQL to save it and reflect the changes in the performed operation on the database.\n",
    "* We can do that using the **commit() method** as shown below,\n",
    "* **`import mysql.connector`**\n",
    "* **`myDB = mysql.connector.connect(host = \"localhost\", user = \"root\", passwd = \"YOUR_PASSWORD\", database = \"pythonx\")`**\n",

    "#**Some methods**\n",
    "* Similarly, we can use any MySQL command using the execute() statement and manipulate using our Python knowledge.\n",
    "* Now let's look at some of the other important Python database methods that you should know,\n",
    "* **fetchone()** - It fetches the next row of a query result set. A result set is an object that is returned when a cursor object is used to query a table.\n",
    "* **fetchall()** - It fetches all the rows in a result set. If some rows have already been extracted from the result set, then it retrieves the remaining rows from the result set. It returns each row as an individual tuple.\n",
    "* **executemany ()** - It works just like execute(), but it is used to execute multiple database queries at a single time. It accepts a list of queries. We can pass a list that can contain the tuple elements of multiple data values that need to be inserted in the table."
