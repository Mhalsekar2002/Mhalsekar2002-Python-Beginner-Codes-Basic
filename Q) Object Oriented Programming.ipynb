    "## Principles\n",
    "Following are the four main principles/properties of object-oriented programming,\n",
    "1) **Abstraction**\n",
    "2) **Encapsulation**\n",
    "3) **Inheritance**\n",
    "4) **Polymorphism**\n",
    "#These are called the 4 pillars of OOP. Let's have a look at each one-by-one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstraction\n",
    "* Abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of object-oriented programming.\n",
    "* **As the name suggests, abstraction means to abstract only the details/data which might concern the user.**\n",
    "* **For example, when you use a mobile phone, you just think about how the touch works, how the fingerprint scanner, home button, camera, etc work.You won't worry about how those things are implemented internally.Those details about the implementation part are hidden from you as a user and you might not worry about it as well.**\n",
    "* **Abstraction is abstracting the details that may concern you.**\n",
    "* But, if you are a software developer, you might want to worry about how all those features work and how they are implemented.\n",
    "* Thus, the abstraction of data differs from person to person and it has levels of abstraction.\n",
    "* Therefore, data abstraction simply refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encapsulation\n",
    "* Abstraction and Encapsulation go hand in hand. In abstraction, we let the user abstract only the details that are required, the rest is hidden.\n",
    "* Similarly in encapsulation, we try to encapsulate all the data as a single entity.\n",
    "* It's just like a black box, where from the one end we can pass input, it processes it and gives the result as an output from the other end.\n",
    "* So, what happens in the black box is completely hidden.\n",
    "* **Encapsulation is just like the real-life capsule that your doctor might give you. Inside the capsule, there are various chemical elements mixed to create a single consumable entity.**\n",
    "* Now, assume that the doctor gives you all those chemical elements and asks you to mix them and take the dosage. Does that make any sense?\n",
    "Of course not! As the consumer, it's not your job to do that.\n",
    "* Thus, **Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data under a single unit.**\n",
    "* Note that, Encapsulation also leads to data abstraction or hiding as using encapsulation also hides the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance\n",
    "* **It's a fact that we inherit a lot of things from our parents. Some properties like looks, skin color, hair, body, and not just properties but also our behaviors.**\n",
    "* That said, one more perk is that we may inherit all the money, wealth, and fortune.\n",
    "* Similarly, in programming, one element can inherit various characteristics and capabilities from another element. (Here the element which we are referring to is a 'class').\n",
    "* Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object-Oriented Programming and supports the concept of **\"reusability\"**\n",
    "* **This simply means, when we want to create some feature and there is already such a feature that includes some of the code that we want, then we can derive our feature from the existing one instead of developing from scratch.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polymorphism\n",
    "* The word polymorphism means having many forms (poly = many, morphism = forms)\n",
    "* In simple words, we can define **polymorphism as the ability of something to have more than one form.**\n",
    "* **Consider a geometric shape. As a whole, it's termed as a shape, but that shape can have many forms such as triangle, circle, square, rectangle, oval, and more.**\n",
    "* Similarly, in programming, an operation may exhibit different behaviors in different instances.\n",
    "* The behavior depends upon the types of data used in the operation."

    "# Classes and Objects\n",
    "* classes and Objects are building blocks of object oriented system.These pillars & building blocks combined make an object oriented program which is althogether a complete program paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes\n",
    "* Just like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and more, classes are some advanced data structures to store, manipulate, and structure the data.\n",
    "* Data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc can group and store only a few attributes, but a class is a type of user-defined structure that can store various attributes, (Data - both primitive and user-defined) along with their functionalities, all together as a single unit.\n",
    "* These attributes and their functionalities (behaviors) can be accessed via Objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#**But what is a class in OOP?**\n",
    "* A class is a user-defined prototype for an object that defines the set of attributes that characterize any object of the class.\n",
    "* In simple words, a class is just like a prototype depending on which the real-world objects are created.\n",
    "* Thus, you can define a class as a **'blueprint to create objects'**.\n",
    "* Consider a simple example. When you develop a building, you won't directly start the construction and the development of the building structure.\n",
    "* The very first step would be to create a blueprint of how you want to create the building and how would it be.\n",
    "* Now, depending upon that blueprint, you would go and create real-world building structures that would be the same but might differ in various attributes and functionalities such as they might have different colors, a different type of windows, different interior, and so on.\n",
    "* But at the most basic level, the base structure would remain the same as defined in the blueprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objects\n",
    "* Objects are called as an **instance of the class**. As we have seen, a class is just a blueprint, so it's just like a description.\n",
    "* According to that description, an object is created which contains the real data.\n",
    "* For instance, all the buildings will be the same, but in each building, we will have different flats that would be completely different depending upon the person who has occupied it.\n",
    "* An object has two things,\n",
    "1) **Attributes (Data variables of the class)**\n",
    "2) **Behaviors (Functions defined in the class)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example\n",
    "* If the building is a class, then color, floors, flats, entrance, etc would be the attributes, and isReady(), isOccupied(), flatAvailable(), etc would be its behaviors that are the methods.\n",
    "* Now, each building would have all these data and behaviors different and unique to themselves.\n",
    "* That's all about Classes and Objects. Don't worry, in the next section, we will start writing some code in Python and you would be able to grasp this theory better.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Why**\n",
    "* Let's consider the following example,\n",
    "* As we have seen in the previous section, we have a class Employee that stores and manages employee details.\n",
    "* Now, assume that we also have interns in our organization. Thus, we would need a new class Intern for that.\n",
    "* But, understand that an intern is also a type of employee, thus it will have all the attributes of the employee such as name, age, and more.\n",
    "* With that, it also might have some additional details.\n",

    "2) **Multiple Inheritance**\n",
    "3) **Hierarchical Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Multilevel Inheritance\n",

    "* Following is the pseudo-code of how it would look,\n",
    "* **`class Employee:`**\n",
    "* **`pass`**\n",
    "* **`class Intern (Employee):`**\n",
    "* **`pass`**\n",
    "* **`class Bonus (Intern):`**\n",
    "* **`pass`**\n",
    "* Here, the Bonus class can access the attributes and behaviors of both Employee and the Intern class.\n",
    "* The Bonus class cannot directly access the Employee class, but since it is inheriting the Intern class which is further inheriting the Employee class and has all the data of the Employee class, it can access both Employee and the Intern class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "* When a class can be derived from more than one base class this type of inheritance is called multiple inheritance.\n",
    "* In multiple inheritance, all the features of the base classes are inherited into the derived class.\n",
    "*Following is the pseudo-code of how it would look,\n",
    "* **`class Company:`**\n",
    "* **`pass`**\n",
    "* **`class Employee:`**\n",
    "* **`pass`**\n",
    "* **`class Intern (Company, Employee):`**\n",
    "* **`pass`**\n",

    "* Consider the example where you have a method named **area()**. Now depending upon the parameters passed, it can behave differently\n",
