    "# Comments in Python\n",
    "* In Python, comments start with the **hash character (#)** and end at the end of the line.In other words, if you want to write a comment, start the line with #.\n",
    "* Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter since they are used to make the code more readable and only for the programmers to refer to\n",
    "* Example of comments in Python:\n",
    "* #Below is the code to print Hello World\n",
    "* **`print(\"Hello World\")`**\n",
    "* Output\n",
    "* `Hello World`\n",
    "* As you can see from the result, the comment isn't actually given as output. It's simply there for the programmer's benefit."

    "# Multi-line Comments\n",
    "* Putting a single-line comment is easy but it can prove to be a huge task if there are multiple lines of code that need to be ignored.\n",
    "* For example, you wrote 100 lines of beautiful code but later realized that from Line 72 till Line 92 needs to be ignored for now.\n",
    "* Does that mean putting (#) symbol close to 20 times?!\n",
    "* Not at all!\n",
    "* If a continuous block of code is enclosed between a pair of triple quotes then that entire block is commented out. These triple quotes are also called **Doc Strings.**"
