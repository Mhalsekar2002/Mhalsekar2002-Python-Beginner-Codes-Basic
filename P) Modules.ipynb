    "# Modules\n",
    "* Modules are just like readymade bread.\n",
    "* Modules refer to file conatining python statements and definitions.These are prewritten codes that are written by someone which can directly use your code.\n",
    "* We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized files\n",
    "* We can define our most used functions in a module and import it, instead of copying their definition into different programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#There are 3 types of modules,\n",
    "* **Built-in modules**\n",
    "* **Third party modules**\n",
    "* **Custom modules**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Built-in modules\n",
    "* As the name suggests, built-in modules are the modules that are available in Python by default.These modules are developed and maintained by the Python developer team.\n",
    "* Thus, to use such modules, you can directly import them into your file and just make the call to the methods that you need.\n",
    "* For instance, the math module is a built-in module in python that provides various mathematical functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Third party modules\n",
    "* These modules are just like the built-in modules in Python. The only major difference is that we need to install them first.\n",
    "* Once they are installed, you can use them just like the built-in modules.\n",
    "* Third-party modules can be installed using the 'pip' command. PIP is a package manager for Python packages.\n",
    "* These modules are uploaded and stored at the PyPI repository. The Python Package Index, abbreviated as PyPI is the official third-party software        repository for Python.\n",
    "* Following is the syntax to download the third- party modules. Hit this command in the command-line/terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#For windows : \n",
    "* **`pip install module_name`**\n",
    "\n",
    "#For MacOs/Linux : \n",
    "* **`pip3 install module_name`**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom modules\n",
    "* Python custom modules are the modules created by the developer.\n",
    "* These modules are simple Python files that can be imported into another Python file/project.\n",
    "* Once imported, you can access all the attributes and methods of the imported file.Such files are called Python custom modules.\n",
    "* This allows you to reuse your code in the same project and also helps you write efficient and fewer lines of code."

    "* The form...import statement\n",
    "\n",
    "## The import statement\n",
    "* We can use the import keyword to do this\n",
    "* To import the module, we can use the following statement,\n",
    "* **`import module_name`**\n",
    "* This will import the whole module into your Python project.\n",
    "* To use the various functions provided by the respective module, we can use the dot (.) operator as shown below,\n",

    "* Where,module_name is the name of the Python module.\n",
    "* functionName() is the name of the function we wish to use from that particular module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Renaming a module\n",
    "* There are situations were the module name is little lengthy.\n",
    "* In such situations, we can rename the module's name while importing it.\n",
    "* We can use the import...as syntax that allows us to do the same. The as keyword helps us in renaming the module as shown below,\n",
    "#**`import module_name as m`**\n",
    "* module_name is the name of the Python module.\n",
    "* 'm' is the new name given to it that can be used to refer to the module further in the project.\n",
    "#For example,\n",
    "* Instead of using the syntax, module_name.functionName(), we can use m.functionName().\n",
    "\n",
    "##  The form...import statement\n",
    "* Let's say you want to buy an egg, just one egg. In such a situation, will it make sense to buy the whole egg tray? Of course not!\n",
    "* Similarly, assume that there is some situation where you need a particular attribute/function/ class from a module.\n",
    "* Then importing the whole module can make your project heavy and a bit slow.\n",
    "* We can use the from...import syntax which allows us to import only the particular name(attribute/function/class) that we want from a module.\n",
    "#Following is the syntax to do so,\n",
    "* **`from module_name import functionName`**\n",
    "\n",

    "* We know that we can use a particular attribute/ function from a module using the dot operator.\n",
    "* But, how to use it in the case of from...import syntax?\n",
    "* It is pretty simple.\n",
    "* Since we have just imported only the particular name from the module that we want, we can directly use it without referring to the module_name using * the dot syntax as shown below,\n",

    "* **array** - In Python, we do not have a concept of arrays. But we can use the array module which defines an object type that can compactly represent an array of basic values: characters, integers, floating-point numbers. Arrays are sequence types and behave very much like lists, except that the type of objects stored in them is constrained.That means an array containing numeric values will not accept a string value to be stored in it.Array Module - https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html\n",
