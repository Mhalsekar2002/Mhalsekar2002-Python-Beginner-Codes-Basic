    "* Tkinter\n",

    "* Python Qt\n",
    "* wxPython\n",
    "* We will be using a Python library Tkinter in this subject for the GUI development in Python. Let's dive straight into it...\n",
    "#**What is Tkinter**\n",
    "* Tkinter is the inbuilt python module that is used to create GUI applications. It is one of the most commonly used modules for creating GUI applications in Python as it is simple and easy to work with.\n",
    "* It gives an object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.\n",
    "* Remember, we learned about something called IDLE in Python?\n",
    "* IDLE is a default IDE for Python which comes with Python installation. It is fully coded in Tkinter.\n",
    "* That's how powerful this module is when it comes to GUI development.\n",
    "#**How to use?**\n",
    "* As we have seen, Tkinter is a built-in module in Python, so there is no need to install it. We can directly import and start using it.\n",
    "* Following is how the Tkinter module import statement would look like,\n",
    "* **`import tkinter`**\n",
    "* To create a GUI app using Tkinter, we have to follow the simple steps given below,\n",
    "1) Importing the module - tkinter\n",

    "# Introduction to Widgets\n",
    "#**Visual Components**\n",
    "* A GUI is a system of interactive visual components for computer software.\n",
    "* Talking about visual components, a GUI comprises various elements such as Buttons, Text(called Labels), Images, Menu, and more.\n",
    "* Tkinter provides us with these common GUI elements which we can use to build out the interface.\n",
    "* These elements are called Widgets.\n",
    "#**Widgets**\n",
    "* In simple words, a Widget is an element of the GUI that displays information or provides a way for the user to interact with the OS.\n",
    "* Therefore, widgets are the elements of GUI applications that provide various controls such as Labels, Buttons, ComboBoxes, CheckBoxes, MenuBars, RadioButtons, and many more to users to interact with the application.\n",
    "#**Representation of Widgets**\n",
    "* Therefore, we understand that widgets in Tkinter are the basic building blocks of the Python GUI application. But, how are they represented in Python?\n",
    "* In Tkinter, Widgets are represented as objects, that is, instances of classes that represent them such as the Button class for the button widget, Frame class for the frame widget, and so on.\n",
    "* So, each separate widget is a Python object.\n",
    "* When creating a widget, you must pass its parent (the parent container that will hold the widget) as a parameter to the widget creation function.\n",
    "#**Widget Classes**\n",
    "* As we know, to use a widget, we will need to create the object of their respective class. Below are a few of the frequently used widget classes,\n",
    "* **Label** - It is used to provide a single-line caption for other widgets. In simple words, It is used to display text and can also contain images.\n",
    "* **Button** - It is used to add buttons to your application. These buttons can perform various actions when clicked.\n",
    "* **Entry** - It is just like the Python input() function, but more GUI in nature. It is used to accept single-line input from the user.\n",
    "* **Text** - It is a text entry widget that allows multiline text entry.\n",
    "* **Frame** - It is used as a container widget to organize other widgets.\n",
    "* **ComboBox** - It contains a down arrow to select from the list of available options. It is just like a dropdown list\n",
    "* **Checkbutton** - It is used to display a number of options as checkboxes. The user can select multiple options at a time\n",
    "* **Radiobutton** - It is used to display a number of options as radio buttons. The user can select only one option at a time\n",
    "* **PanedWindow** - It is a container widget that may contain any number of panes, arranged horizontally or vertically\n",
    "* **Canvas** - It is used to draw shapes, such as lines, ovals, polygons, and rectangles, in your application\n",
    "* **tkMessageBox** - Well, it's not a widget but a complete Python module. It is used to display message(dialog) boxes in our applications."
