    "* Answer: Python is a **general-purpose programming language** that has a simple, easy- to-learn syntax that emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.\n",
    "* Moreover, the language is capable of scripting, completely **open-source,** and supports third- party packages that encourage modularity and code-reuse.\n",
    "* Its high-level data structures, combined with **dynamic typing and dynamic binding**, attract a huge community of developers for Rapid Application Development and Deployment.\n",

    "* Python is dynamically typed, so there is no need to declare a variable with the data type. Python Interpreter will identify the data type on the basis of the value of the variable.\n",
    "* **Python follows an object-oriented programming paradigm** with the exception of having access specifiers. Other than access specifiers (public and private keywords), Python has classes, inheritance, and all other usual OOPs concepts.\n",
    "* **Python is literally a general-purpose language,** i.e., Python finds its way in various domains such as web application development, automation, Data Science, Machine Learning, and more."
